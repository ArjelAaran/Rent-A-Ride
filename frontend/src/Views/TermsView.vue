        <h2>2. Rental Requirements</h2>
        <p>All users must successfully complete the system's authentication process (signup/login) to access services and abide by any documentation required by the Owner. To confirm a booking, the Renter must submit a "proof of payment" image that is manually approved by the Owner or Admin.</p>

        <h2>3. Liability and Insurance</h2>
